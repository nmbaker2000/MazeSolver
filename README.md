# MazeSolver
This houses my maze solving algorithim

The algorirhm has an issue with some mazes, specifically if a solution does not exist. Most of the mazes without solutions will display that a solution does not exist, but a couple either displayed incorrectly, or they would enter into an infinite recurssion loop, but this was far and few between.

If a solution does exist, this program should display the shortest path possible to the exit.
